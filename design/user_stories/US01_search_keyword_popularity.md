**I want** to identify the most popular search keywords and phrases
**So that** I can understand what users are most interested in.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A report or query exists that lists search keywords by frequency.
- The report is updated as new data is ingested.
- Results are deduplicated and based on the silver layer.
