# User Story: Trending Searches

**As** a product manager
**I want** to see what search terms are trending now
**So that** I can react to changes in user interest.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A report or query exists that shows trending search terms over recent time windows (e.g., 1d, 7d, 30d).
- Trending is calculated using recent vs. historical frequency.
- Results are deduplicated and based on the silver layer.
