# Dashboard Design

- Show a graph of searches per day, over the last year.
- Show popular top 5 searches this week, and this month (top 10). it would also be interesting to see if there are any seasonal trends in searches, and movement of search terms up and down the popularity rankings (with a green up an red down arrow).
- The dashboard should be updated hourly
- show a breakdown (pie chart?) of searches by device, and OS (the search agent),
- I'd also like to see a breakdown of searches by country (again a pie chart maybe?) - can we do a lookup of the IP address to get the country?
- show the most popular pages, and the types of pages - blog, project, course, review etc.
- show the number of new users, returning users, and total users over the last month
